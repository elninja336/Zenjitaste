        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>ZenjiTaste was born from a simple idea: to connect travelers with the authentic flavors and warm hospitality of Zanzibar. We believe that the best way to understand a culture is through its food, shared with the people who prepare it with love and tradition.</p>
        <p>Founded in 2024, we've created a platform that empowers local families and restaurants to share their culinary heritage while providing tourists with unforgettable, meaningful experiences that go beyond typical tourist attractions.</p>
